    <p class="text">Albert Einstein  was a German-born theoretical physicist 
         who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics 
         (alongside quantum mechanics).[3][6]:274 His work is also known for its influence 
         on the philosophy of science.[7][8] He is best known to the general public for his 
         massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most 
         famous equation".[9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to 
         theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric 
         effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>
